# Phantoma Strategic Roadmap (2026)

The roadmap focuses on three pillars: **Sovereignty, Scalability, and Hardware Integration.**

## Phase 1: The Shadow Gateway (Q1 2026) - CURRENT
* **Infrastructure Hardening:** Finalizing the automated VPS-to-Bunker transformation scripts.
* **Early Access Program:** Onboarding strategic partners in Finance and Healthcare.
* **Encrypted Inference Tunnels:** Support for major high-performance LLM providers.

## Phase 2: Distributed Sovereignty Mesh (Q2 2026)
* **Multi-Node Orchestration:** Deploying intelligence across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.
* **Privacy-Preserving Load Balancing:** Routing traffic based on real-time data residency compliance.
* **Local Influx:** Integration for running open-source models (Llama 3, Mistral) within the Phantoma hardened perimeter.

## Phase 3: Sovereign OS & Hardware (Q3 - Q4 2026)
* **Phantoma OS:** A custom, minimal Linux distribution stripped of all non-essential components to minimize attack surface.
* **Hardware-Level Attestation:** Utilizing TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) to guarantee data safety at the silicon level.
* **Enterprise Control Plane:** A centralized dashboard for global sovereignty management.
