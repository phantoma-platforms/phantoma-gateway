## 🏛 The Thesis

Phantoma is a high-performance, shadow-gateway layer designed to decouple **Intelligence** from **Centralized Surveillance**. 



Modern AI infrastructure forces enterprises to trade proprietary data for inference. Phantoma breaks this trade-off by providing a **Transparent Sovereignty Layer (TSL)**. Deploy private, hardened AI bunkers on any VPS infrastructure in seconds.

## 🛡 Security Architecture



Phantoma transforms a standard VPS into a fortified node. We don't just "encrypt" data; we make it invisible to the host provider.



| Feature | Standard Cloud AI | Phantoma Protocol |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Data Residency** | Third-party Servers | **Your Sovereign VPS** |

| **Data Persistence** | Permanent Logs | **Zero (Ephemeral Memory)** |

| **Identity** | Corporate Fingerprinting | **Ghost Proxy Routing** |

| **Encryption** | Standard TLS | **AES-256-GCM + ECDH** |
