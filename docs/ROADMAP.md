# Phantoma Development Roadmap

Our goal is to transition from a "Secure Wrapper" to a "Sovereign OS for AI".

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Shadow Gateway (Egress Control)
- [x] Atomic Ephemerality (RAM-only processing)
- [x] Multi-Sig Signing for Alpha Releases
- [ ] Support for local model quantization (GGUF/EXL2)

## Phase 2: Orchestration (Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant RBAC:** Isolated perimeters for different departments within the same VPS.
- [ ] **Invisible Forensic Watermarking:** Trace data leaks back to the specific session/user without modifying model output.
- [ ] **Hardware-Enclave Support:** Integration with Intel SGX and AMD SEV for TEE (Trusted Execution Environments).

## Phase 3: The Sovereign Mesh (Q4 2026)
- [ ] **Immutable Audit Logs:** Distributed ledger for compliance audits that can't be tampered with by the VPS admin.
- [ ] **P2P Model Sharding:** Distributing large models across multiple private nodes without exposing weights.
